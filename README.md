The question has two subparts; with the help of a program, it explains the calculation of turn around time with respect to waiting time and burst time. 
Secondly, it explains the possibility of detecting a deadlock condition.
Deadlock refers to the condition where there is a limitation of resources to be allocated to the processes, thus restricting its functioning.
If the number of resources required for the maximum efficiency of a process is given, and the number of resources given to the processes is also inputed, we can mathematically represent the minimal working or functioning of processes with the help of permutation and combination.
